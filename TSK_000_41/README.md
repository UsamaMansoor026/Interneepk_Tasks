# Internee.pk Clone

Welcome to the Internee.pk Clone project! This project is a front-end clone of the Internee.pk website, built using React.js. It showcases a fully responsive design with smooth transitions and eye-catching animations.

I made a few changes that is the navbar style in small devices, adding shadows to the navbar and icons.

By making this project, I learn how to use React reuseable components to render dynamic data that keeps the codebase clean and efficient.

I create many components in this project like Navbar, Cards, Footer, Blog, TypingText and many more. Though it is a SPA (Single Page Application) so there is only one page which is Home Page.

I craeted a separate file in assets folder named assets.js which include all the images, icons and the dynamic data that I need in this project.
