# Rest API Example

This react application is an example of a REST API Calls and handling the response and errors in case of something goes wrong.

I utilize the api of Fake Store fetch the Products and display in my UI.

In addition to simply displaying the fetched Products, I also create some more functionalities like:

1. Product pop up Deatil Modal:
   When user click on any product, the Modal appers with the detail of that specific product.

2. Remove button:
   Each product have a remove button which handle the remove functionlaity, when user click on that button that product remove from the UI.
