# Internee.pk Clone

Welcome to the Internee.pk Clone project! This project is a front-end clone of the Internee.pk website, built using React.js. It showcases a fully responsive design with smooth transitions and eye-catching animations.

I made few chaanges from the original website, which is the mobile navbar design, adding shadows to the navbar and the icons.
